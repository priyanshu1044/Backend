we use the connectDB() in the index.js after that we use
.then and .catch 
beacuse we use the async in the db configration file it returns promise 



for the file upload we use third party npm package multer 


in new node we dont need to use body parser beacuse we can use builtin express.json()

and for the url encodeation we use express.urlencoded({extended:true})
extended for the object in object nested object
